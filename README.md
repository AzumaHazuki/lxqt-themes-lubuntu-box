# lxqt-themes-lubuntu-box
LXQt port of the "Box" theme from Lubuntu 18.04, before the move away from LXDE to LXQt

This repository includes the Ozone wallpaper and a refactored version of the "Lubuntu-default" Openbox theme, originally created by Rafael Laguna for Lubuntu 18.04.
In order for this theme to look right, please match the Panel height and Panel Icons size (the screenshot below shows 32px for both). The tarball is the Openbox theme
and may be extracted directly into ~/.themes/
